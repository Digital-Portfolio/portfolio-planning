# Portfolio Planning

**Part 1:** Start by researching 4-6 roles in the field, review the postings and outline overlapping requirements they all have in their posting. Copy the posting name, and URL, and screenshot the requirements as postings can be gone the next day. In addition to job posting visuals, in 3-5 sentences explain what about these positions interest you, and what areas in their required skills will you need to learn/develop to be ready to apply for a similar job. 

**Part 2:** Come up with at least 4 project ideas for your portfolio, we will not necessarily create these exact projects, but they will be an inspiration and guide for future work. For each of these project ideas create a mood board (Pinterest board, visual collage, or assorted media of your choice) and in 3-5 sentences explain what about these digital creations/types of work interest you, what skills they showcase, and what programs/applications they would require.

2 major projects - These are larger types of projects that showcase a variety of skills from multiple programs (editorials, multi-platform layouts/ad campaigns, mobile/web design, brand packages, or package design) 
2 minor projects - These are smaller projects that showcase a more focused skillset, often within a single program (Illustrator graphic creation, Photoshop compositions/visual manipulation, or smaller ad/social campaigns) 
All portfolio project work must be yours, you can use royalty-free or open-source images, fonts, and related basic graphics. But any showcase of focused graphical work must be your own. 
Visuals + explanation, not one or the other in every project so make sure to combine your research and explanation of design choices from planning to your final uploaded work.
