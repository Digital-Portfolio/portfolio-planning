Copy the posting name, and URL, and screenshot the requirements as postings can be gone the next day. In addition to job posting visuals, in 3-5 sentences explain what about these positions interest you, and what areas in their required skills will you need to learn/develop to be ready to apply for a similar job. </p> <p>Part 2: Come up with at least 4 project ideas for your portfolio, we will not necessarily create these exact projects, but they will be an inspiration and guide for future work. For each of these project ideas create a mood board (Pinterest board, visual collage, or assorted media of your choice) and in 3-5 sentences explain what about these digital creations/types of work interest you, what skills they showcase, and what programs/applications they would require.</p> <p>2 major projects - These are larger types of projects that showcase a variety of skills from multiple programs (editorials, multi-platform layouts/ad campaigns, mobile/web design, brand packages, or package design)  2 minor projects - These are smaller projects that showcase a more focused skillset, often within a single program (Illustrator graphic creation, Photoshop compositions/visual manipulation, or smaller ad/social campaigns)  All portfolio project work must be yours, you can use royalty-free or open-source images, fonts, and related basic graphics. But any showcase of focused graphical work must be your own.  Visuals + explanation, not one or the other in every project so make sure to combine your research and explanation of design choices from planning to your final uploaded work.</p>"},{"location":"projects/BulletProof-Studio-Tools/","title":"BulletProof Studio Tools","text":"<p>A budgeting app for VFX and Films.</p> <ul> <li>Currently working on an industry project with 4 other developers. </li> <li>NDA</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/Food-Website-Make-Over/","title":"Food Website Make Over","text":"<p>Create an analysis for an already existing website with room for improvement.</p>"},{"location":"projects/Our-SOS/","title":"Our SOS","text":"<ul> <li>Your lifeline in times of crisis.

The app also incorporated a translation feature for people with a native language different than English. We also added features like Friends, where users can ensure all their friends and family members are safe even though they might be in a different part of the world.</p>"},{"location":"projects/Our-SOS/#design-of-the-project","title":"Design of the Project","text":"<p>The D3 students created the design of the app; the design had three simple tabs for three different views for a dashboard, map, and settings page.</p>"},{"location":"projects/Our-SOS/#development","title":"Development","text":"<p>In the project's development, the team decided creating an app for mobile devices would be better. So, the app's front end used Expo, Typescript, and Tailwind. As it is a public safety app, we wanted the best performance and created a Backend in GO. I mainly worked on the Backend, where I pulled data from different APIs using a cron job and Stored it in a Redis Storage. For user data management, we used PostgreSQL. The images were uploaded to Azure Blobs. We ensured that only the emergencies near the user location or their friends were shown for optimization.</p>"},{"location":"projects/Our-SOS/#take-away","title":"Take Away","text":"<p>I learned about Expo, Golang, and cache. Many things were built on top of my previous knowledge, but there were things I learned about Go's concurrency model and validating/invalidating the cache. I also experienced mobile development, where we converted a mobile Figma design to an actual working app that provides value to users. Also, we had a big team of 8 people, so communication was the key, and I definitely improved my communication skills while working in a development team.</p>"},{"location":"projects/Our-SOS/#things-to-improve","title":"Things to improve","text":"<p>The things to improve would be taking smaller steps and incremental development and deployment. Some parts of the app would not make it to the final version as they were breaking things. If we had caught them early on, we would have development would have been much smoother. But overall, the project turned out great, and I am thankful for everyone who contributed.</p>"},{"location":"projects/Tmp-Code/","title":"Tmp Code","text":"<p>Currently Contributing to a AI code editor, that generates code based on prompt and have a history where developer can checkout other versions of the code.</p> <pre><code>mindmap\n      root((tmp codes))\n        Features\n          Text Editor\n          AI Prompt\n            Generates code based on the prompt in any coding language\n          history of AI generated code\n          vim key bindings\n        Tools\n          ReactJS SPA\n          AWS S3 to store code\n          login using kinde\n\n\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"projects/Trebble%20Music/","title":"Trebble Music","text":"<p>Music app that allows users to create a library from youtube, spotify, or manually by adding an MP3 File with a thumbnail.</p> <p>Listeners can share the music on different platforms. </p> <p>This project interests me because </p> <ul> <li>I love music based application</li> <li>Allows listners to download music from youtube, without the premium membership</li> </ul> <p>Skill set Showcase: - It shows that I can create a Full Stack Application with Authentication, Frontend in NextJS, Backend Server components, and AWS s3 for storing images and mp3 files. </p> <pre><code>mindmap\n      root((Treble mp3))\n        Features\n          Music Player\n          OAuth\n          Search Feature\n          Share Music \n        Tools\n          Components and Logic \n            Next client and server components\n          Storage\n            Image and Mp3 storage AWS S3\n          Oauth \n            Next Auth\n          Music Download \n            YoutubeDL\n          Search Feature\n            Algolia\n\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"roles/Gt.School/","title":"Gt.School","text":""},{"location":"roles/Gt.School/#full-stack-engineer-gtschool","title":"Full Stack Engineer, gt.school","text":"<p>Crossover  \u00b7 Vancouver, BC</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"roles/Gt.School/#interest-reasons","title":"Interest Reasons","text":"<ul> <li> <p>I think the pay is fair, and is above the minimum pay(80k) I want to work for and the position is in Vancouver as I do not want to relocate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Transparent interview process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chance to work with AI and a modern web stack.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"roles/Gt.School/#areas-to-improve","title":"Areas to improve","text":"<ul> <li>Polish up my Angular skills.</li> <li>Learn about the latest serverless cloud platforms.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"roles/amazon/","title":"Amazon","text":""},{"location":"roles/amazon/#software-development-engineer-intern-2024-canada","title":"Software Development Engineer Intern - 2024, Canada","text":"<p>Amazon \u00b7 Vancouver, BC</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"roles/amazon/#interest-reasons","title":"Interest Reasons","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Chance to for a Big company</p> </li> <li> <p>I'm familiar with the tech stack.</p> </li> <li> <p>Benefits and Pay</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"roles/amazon/#areas-to-improve","title":"Areas to improve","text":"<ul> <li>Polish up my algorithms and data structure skills.</li> <li>Improve my C# skills.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"roles/tetra/","title":"Tetra","text":""},{"location":"roles/tetra/#full-stack-developer","title":"Full Stack Developer","text":"<p>Tetra Tech \u00b7 Vancouver, BC</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"roles/tetra/#interest-reasons","title":"Interest Reasons","text":"<ul> <li> <p>This position interest me because I'm extremly comfortable with the technology stack.</p> </li> <li> <p>I think the pay is fair, and is above the minimum pay(80k) I want to work for and the position is in Vancouver as I do not want to relocate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Opportunity to work with 3d visualization</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"roles/vallum-associates/","title":"Vallum associates","text":""},{"location":"roles/vallum-associates/#vallum-associates","title":"Vallum Associates","text":"<p>Vallum Associates \u00b7 Netherlands </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"roles/vallum-associates/#interest-reasons","title":"Interest Reasons","text":"<ul> <li> <p>I think the pay is good, the only place is would like to work at the moment outside of Vancouver is Utrecht as I have some friends there and seems like a great place to live and work.</p> </li> <li> <p>I extremly comfortable with the technology stack (React Jsx, and React Native)</p> </li> <li> <p>Could be a great position for growth and proving my skills.</p> </li> <li> <p>I have a perfect match for skills as shown below.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p>"}]}
