Copy the posting name, and URL, and screenshot the requirements as postings can be gone the next day. In addition to job posting visuals, in 3-5 sentences explain what about these positions interest you, and what areas in their required skills will you need to learn/develop to be ready to apply for a similar job. Part 2: Come up with at least 4 project ideas for your portfolio, we will not necessarily create these exact projects, but they will be an inspiration and guide for future work. For each of these project ideas create a mood board (Pinterest board, visual collage, or assorted media of your choice) and in 3-5 sentences explain what about these digital creations/types of work interest you, what skills they showcase, and what programs/applications they would require. 2 major projects - These are larger types of projects that showcase a variety of skills from multiple programs (editorials, multi-platform layouts/ad campaigns, mobile/web design, brand packages, or package design) 2 minor projects - These are smaller projects that showcase a more focused skillset, often within a single program (Illustrator graphic creation, Photoshop compositions/visual manipulation, or smaller ad/social campaigns) All portfolio project work must be yours, you can use royalty-free or open-source images, fonts, and related basic graphics. But any showcase of focused graphical work must be your own. Visuals + explanation, not one or the other in every project so make sure to combine your research and explanation of design choices from planning to your final uploaded work.","title":"Portfolio Planning"},{"location":"#portfolio-planning","text":"Part 1: Start by researching 4-6 roles in the field, review the postings and outline overlapping requirements they all have in their posting.

The app provides accessibility using language translation\u2014and Alerts users when an emergency is near them. It also includes AI help in case of crisis. Initial Idea The Initial Ideation for the App was done by the D3 Students (Meelaud, Neema, and Parker), who we worked with to develop this app. The idea was to create a public safety app using the latest data and train AI to help people in Danger. The app also incorporated a translation feature for people with a native language different than English. We also added features like Friends, where users can ensure all their friends and family members are safe even though they might be in a different part of the world. Design of the Project The D3 students created the design of the app; the design had three simple tabs for three different views for a dashboard, map, and settings page. Development In the project's development, the team decided creating an app for mobile devices would be better. So, the app's front end used Expo, Typescript, and Tailwind. As it is a public safety app, we wanted the best performance and created a Backend in GO. I mainly worked on the Backend, where I pulled data from different APIs using a cron job and Stored it in a Redis Storage. For user data management, we used PostgreSQL. The images were uploaded to Azure Blobs. We ensured that only the emergencies near the user location or their friends were shown for optimization. Take Away I learned about Expo, Golang, and cache. Many things were built on top of my previous knowledge, but there were things I learned about Go's concurrency model and validating/invalidating the cache. I also experienced mobile development, where we converted a mobile Figma design to an actual working app that provides value to users. Also, we had a big team of 8 people, so communication was the key, and I definitely improved my communication skills while working in a development team. Things to improve The things to improve would be taking smaller steps and incremental development and deployment. Some parts of the app would not make it to the final version as they were breaking things. If we had caught them early on, we would have development would have been much smoother. But overall, the project turned out great, and I am thankful for everyone who contributed.","title":"Our SOS"},{"location":"projects/Our-SOS/#our-sos","text":"Your lifeline in times of crisis.
